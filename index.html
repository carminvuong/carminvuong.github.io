            The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, 
            When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to 
            dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to 
            assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which 
            the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the 
            opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel 
            them to the separation.
